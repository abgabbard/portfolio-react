            As you can see from my work, I believe the most important solution
            is the human solution. I have been called a Solutions Engineer, a
            Senior Sales Engineer, or even an Onbaording Team Lead, but I am
            human just like you. And I care about helping people achieve their
            vision and goals. <p></p>Most importantly, I am a people person. I am fun
            to be around. I am energetic, passionate, and encouraging. I want to
            see you do your best work right alongside me doing mine. I enjoy
            learning and I enjoy helping others learn. What can we accomplish
            together?
